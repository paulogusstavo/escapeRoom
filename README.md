This software was intended to simulate an explosive bomb,composed of 12 armed modules. Each module should be disarmed with the answer of the questions passed to the students. There was no penalty in case of insertion of an invalid response, thus being possible multiple attempts. When entering a valid answer, the respective module was automatically disarmed, and similarly, a clue was released. 

As part of the game, the clues did not follow an order to unravel the mystery, and yet, null clues could be offered as a way to maximize the complexity of solving the problem. Upon arriving at half the activity (30 minutes), the software simulated receiving a new video message recorded with the prisoner, which asked the students to be faster and more agile in the resolution because she needed help to escape.

It is worth noting that it was not necessary to complete the activity for the prisoner to be found and released. If the students could deduce the location of the safe house, they could leave the room looking for the prisoner.
